1- What is a continuous sound wave?

Ans- A continuous sound wave is a signal with an infinite number of signal values over time, representing the analog nature of sound.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

2- Why is digital representation necessary for audio data?

Ans- Digital representation is necessary to convert the continuous sound wave into discrete values that digital devices can process, store, and transmit.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

3- What are common audio file formats, and how do they differ?

Ans- Common formats include .wav, .flac, and .mp3, which differ in how they compress the digital audio signal.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

4- What is the role of a microphone in audio digitization?

Ans- A microphone converts sound waves into an electrical signal, which can then be digitized.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

5- What is sampling in audio processing?

Ans- Sampling is the process of measuring the value of a continuous signal at fixed time intervals.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

6- What does the sampling rate signify?

Ans- The sampling rate indicates the number of samples taken per second, measured in hertz (Hz).

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

7- What is the Nyquist limit?

Ans- The Nyquist limit is the highest frequency that can be captured, which is half the sampling rate.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

8- Why is a consistent sampling rate important in audio processing?

Ans- A consistent sampling rate ensures uniform temporal resolution and prevents difficulties in model generalization.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

9- What does bit depth represent in digital audio?

Ans- Bit depth determines the precision with which the amplitude of a sound wave is captured in each sample.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

10- How does bit depth affect quantization noise?

Ans- Higher bit depth reduces quantization noise, making the digital audio representation more accurate.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

11- What is the amplitude of sound, and how is it measured?

Ans- Amplitude represents the sound pressure level, perceived as loudness, and is measured in decibels (dB).

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

12- What is a waveform in audio data?

Ans- A waveform is a time-domain representation that visualizes the sample values of an audio signal over time.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

13- What does a frequency spectrum represent?

Ans- A frequency spectrum shows the individual frequencies in an audio signal and their amplitudes.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

14- How is a spectrogram different from a waveform?

Ans- A spectrogram visualizes frequency content over time, showing how frequencies change, whereas a waveform shows amplitude changes over time.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

15- What is the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT)?

Ans- STFT is an algorithm that computes the spectrogram by taking multiple Fourier transforms over small time segments of an audio signal.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

16- Why are spectrograms useful in audio analysis?

Ans- Spectrograms allow the visualization of time, frequency, and amplitude in one graph, helping to identify features like instruments or vowel sounds.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

17- What is a Mel Spectrogram?

Ans- A Mel Spectrogram is a variation of a spectrogram that maps the frequency axis to the Mel scale, which approximates the human ear's frequency perception.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

18- How does a Mel Spectrogram differ from a standard spectrogram?

Ans- A standard spectrogram uses a linear frequency axis, while a Mel Spectrogram uses the Mel scale, which reflects the non-linear frequency sensitivity of the human ear.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

19- What is the Mel scale, and why is it used in Mel Spectrograms?

Ans- The Mel scale is a perceptual scale of pitches that approximates human ear sensitivity to different frequencies, with higher sensitivity to lower frequencies. Itâ€™s used to better capture perceptually meaningful audio features.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

20- What role does the Mel filterbank play in generating a Mel Spectrogram?

Ans- The Mel filterbank applies a set of filters to the frequency spectra to map them from the linear frequency axis to the Mel scale.
