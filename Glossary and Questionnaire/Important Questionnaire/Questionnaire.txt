1- What is a continuous sound wave?

Ans- A continuous sound wave is a signal with an infinite number of signal values over time, representing the analog nature of sound.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

2- Why is digital representation necessary for audio data?

Ans- Digital representation is necessary to convert the continuous sound wave into discrete values that digital devices can process, store, and transmit.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

3- What are common audio file formats, and how do they differ?

Ans- Common formats include .wav, .flac, and .mp3, which differ in how they compress the digital audio signal.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

4- What is the role of a microphone in audio digitization?

Ans- A microphone converts sound waves into an electrical signal, which can then be digitized.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

5- What is sampling in audio processing?

Ans- Sampling is the process of measuring the value of a continuous signal at fixed time intervals.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

6- What does the sampling rate signify?

Ans- The sampling rate indicates the number of samples taken per second, measured in hertz (Hz).

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

7- What is the Nyquist limit?

Ans- The Nyquist limit is the highest frequency that can be captured, which is half the sampling rate.

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

8- Why is a consistent sampling rate important in audio processing?

Ans- A consistent sampling rate ensures uniform temporal resolution and prevents difficulties in model generalization.
